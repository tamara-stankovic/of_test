If you would like to run the notebook:

pip install -r requirements.txt

and then add that virtualenv to your jupyter installation. Some aditional data that i used can be found in the Data dir.
Also, the gene2pubmed file is quite large, so you will need to manually add it to the Data dir. The instructions on how to do this are in the notebook itself.
